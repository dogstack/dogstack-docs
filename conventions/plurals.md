# Convention: Plurals with 's', no exceptions

English is a silly language with many special cases.

When writing **code**, we recommend when you plural a word, you **always** add an 's', with no exceptions.

This means:

- dog -> dogs
- bird -> birds
- person -> persons
- moose -> mooses
- mouse -> mouses
- sheep -> sheeps

The reasons for this convention:

- Search and replace becomes way easier!
- No variable name conflicts in cases like "sheep"

However, we do not recommend showing this form of pluralization to the user, it's purely a development convention.
